The operatives maintained a presence in the town and set markets and shops ablaze. Thereafter, a part of the operatives in Geidam town attacked GF/NA base located on the outskirts of Geidam, prompting GF to return fire and deployed Close Air Support (CAS). The exchange lasted for several minutes and during the armed clash, the operatives shot and killed at least two GF. Eventually, the operatives retreated to the town to join the other group, where they maintained presence till 25.04.2021. While in the town, and on 24.04.2021 they set ablaze the house of the Emir, civilian vehicles, a fire service truck, construction equipment and two communication masts. The operatives also fired a projectile that landed in a residential area and killed at least 11 civilians. Subsequently, the operatives hoisted their flags, planted Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) around the town before they temporarily retreated. On 25.04.2021, GF/NA deployed and engaged the operatives on the outskirts of the town until the operatives retreated into the town. During the armed clash, GF shot and killed at least five operatives and seized at least two OAG vehicles. Upon returning to the town, the operatives targeted and slaughtered two male teachers (one of them was a Christian). They also *burlary* shops, *looting* foodstuff and destroyed several shops. Additionally, the operatives hijacked an IO truck loaded with supplies and *looting* the supplies. Thereafter, the operatives temporarily retreated from the town at about midday. They later returned into the town in the evening and maintained their presence. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the operatives planted IEDs in different areas – a tactic that ISWAP has employed in the past to delay and inflict casualties on GF/NA reinforcements. ISWAP claimed the attack via Amaq on 24.04.2021.
